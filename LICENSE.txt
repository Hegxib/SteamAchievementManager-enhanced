All Rights Reserved for Enhanced Features

PROTECTED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:

The following features, systems, algorithms, and implementations are the 
exclusive intellectual property of HEGXIB and constitute original, innovative 
work that does NOT exist in the original SAM or any other achievement manager:

1. INTELLIGENT ACHIEVEMENT SYSTEM
   - Steam Global Statistics Integration
   - Real-time global achievement percentage fetching and display
   - Achievement sorting by global completion rates (Steam-like ordering)
   - "% of Players" column with live API data synchronization
   - Automatic achievement ordering matching Steam's native interface

2. REALISTIC UNLOCK TIMING ALGORITHM (Patent-Pending Concept)
   - Exponential scaling formula based on achievement rarity
   - Smart distribution system with automatic time calculation
   - Realistic unlock intervals: 85% = 15min, 0.1% = 100+ hours
   - Mathematical difficulty time calculation using exponential curves
   - Rarity-based weighting system with normalized distribution
   - Algorithmic formula: time = baseTime × e^(k × rarityScore)

3. AUTO-UNLOCK SYSTEM
   - Background monitoring and automatic achievement unlocking
   - Scheduled unlock time management and persistence
   - Real-time clock-based trigger system
   - Silent background processing without user intervention
   - Integration with callback timer for seamless execution

4. SMART AUTO-CLOSE TIMER INTEGRATION
   - Persistent countdown timer with state saving/restoration
   - Automatic duration calculation from remaining time
   - Visual countdown display in window title
   - Silent auto-close without user confirmation
   - Session state management across app restarts
   - Auto-sync with smart distribution system

5. BULK OPERATIONS & AUTOMATION
   - Bulk Set Times dialog with intelligent defaults
   - Automatic mode detection (auto-close timer integration)
   - Smart distribution as default behavior
   - Apply to All / Selected achievements management
   - Manual override options with fixed intervals

6. GAME MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS
   - Select All / Clear All functionality
   - Persistent game selection with automatic saving/restoration
   - Integrated playtime display from Steam local files
   - Enhanced context menu with quick actions
   - Launch Random from Selected functionality

7. USER INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS
   - Dynamic instruction labels based on context
   - Auto-mode visual indicators
   - Enhanced list view with custom columns
   - Real-time UI updates during background operations
   - Improved visual feedback and status indicators

8. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS
   - PlaytimeReader for Steam local file parsing
   - Global achievement percentage API wrapper
   - Exponential distribution calculation engine
   - Background scheduled unlock monitoring system
   - Timer state persistence system
   - Achievement info data structure enhancements
